   (1) directed or undirected, (2) dense or sparse, and (3) cyclic or acyclic:

   (a) Facebook 
		Undirected, sparse, cyclic
   (b) Twitter
		Directed, sparse, cyclic
   (c) a family
		Undirected, dense, cyclic
   (d) V=airports, E=direct_flights
		Directed, sparse, cyclics
   (e) a mesh
		undirected, dense, cyclic
   (f) V=courses, E=prerequisites
		directed, sparse, acyclic
   (g) a tree
		undirected, sparse, acyclic
   (h) V=linux_software_packages, E=dependencies
		directed, sparse, acyclic
   (i) DP subproblems for 0-1 knapsack
		directed, sparse, acyclic
