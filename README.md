# Algorithms
Series of homework projects for school, all revolving around various algorithms.


## HW1:
- qsort.py: implementation of quicksort, as well as a BST search algorithm
- qselect.py: Quick select implementation. Finds the nth lowest number in a list using modified quicksort

## HW2:
- inversions.py: Counts how many times numbers in reverse order appear in a list
- longest.py: Finds the longest path through a BST
- msort.py: Merge sort implementation

## HW3:
- closest_sorted.py: finds the k closest numbers to a in a sorted array using a binary search
- closest_unsorted.py: finds k closest number to a in an unsorted array using quick select
- xyz.py: finds elements x,y,z in an array such that x + y = z

## HW4:
- datastream.py: finds k smallest numbers efficiently in a large arry
- kmergesort.py: merge sort implementation where the array is split k times instead of the usual 2
- nbest.py: finds values x in array a, y in array b, such that x + y is in a. There are 3 different implementations included.

## HW5:
- bitstrings.py: Exercise in dynamic programming: a function that finds the number of bit strings of length k with two consectuve 0s 
and another that does the same but with no two consecutive 0s
- bsts.py: Calculates the number of possible bst orientations with n nodes
- mis.py: I think this has something to do with the sum on two non consecutive numbers in a list, but I'm not entirely sure.

## HW6:
- knapsack_bounded.py: Implementation of bounded knapsack
- knapsack_unbounded.py: Implementation of unbounded knapsack

## HW7:
- This one doesn't exist

## HW8:
- topol.py: organizes graphs in topological order
- virterbi.py: Calculates the shortest path through a graph in topological order. A lot like Dijkstra's algorithm

## HW9:
- dijkstra.py: Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm
- heapdict.py: not mine, library used for other algorithms
- nbest.py: I don't really know what this one does. I think it has something to do a grid of a and b arrays?

## HW10:
- rna.py: given a string of rna nucleotides, returns a list of all possible folded configurations of that peice of rna.
