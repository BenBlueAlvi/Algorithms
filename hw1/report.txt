0. Q: What's the best-case, worst-case, and average-case time complexities of quicksort.
   Briefly explain each case.
   
	Best case: O(nlogn), occurs when the array being sorted is not already sorted and not already sorted in reverse order
	Worst case: O(n^2), occurs whent the array is already sorted or sorted in reverse order. Because either side of the BST created via quicksort is heavy, quicksort
	rarely moves elements around, and thus only performs comparisons.
